            <h2>üñºÔ∏è Background</h2>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>
                <br>
                Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) stands as the leading visual impairment diagnosis in the United States, yet remains 
                largely unknown to the general public. This condition, predominantly affecting babies and young children, stems from damage 
                to the brain's visual processing centers rather than issues with the eyes themselves. While the brain struggles to interpret 
                signals from otherwise functional eyes, CVI offers hope through appropriate intervention and vision rehabilitation. Children 
                with this condition require early intervention, specialized therapy, and educational support, but face a significant gap in 
                accessible technology. The digital landscape lacks adequate applications on both Android and iOS platforms that address the 
                unique visual needs of young CVI patients, effectively barring them from the wealth of online literacy resources available 
                to their typically-sighted peers. 
                <br><br>
                This project originated when researchers at the University of Northern Colorado identified the need for specialized digital 
                tools and approached UNC faculty for development assistance. The request was ultimately directed to App Team Carolina, a 
                nonprofit student organization focused on iOS application development for which I was a UI/UX Designer. Our vision was to 
                create an interactive gaming application designed to help young CVI patients playfully improve their condition through gradual 
                visual stimulation exercises. The design incorporated innovative strategies developed by Dr. Christine Roman-Lantzy, including 
                the bubble-word technique where children learn to recognize words by matching them to their distinctive bubble shapes, helping 
                them identify and understand visual features more effectively.
                <br><br>
                As my inaugural design project with App Team Carolina, this initiative held special significance in my development as a UI/UX 
                designer. My involvement extended beyond design responsibilities when I stepped into a team lead role for one semester, where 
                I coordinated with developers and project managers to advance the application. This dual perspective allowed me to bridge the 
                technical implementation challenges with user-centered design principles, ensuring the final product remained focused on the 
                unique needs of children with CVI. The opportunity to create technology that makes a meaningful difference in accessibility 
                and education became a foundational experience in my design career.

            <div class="separator"></div>
            <h3>Preliminary Research</h3>
            <p>
                Given the specialized nature of Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) and our limited direct access to affected individuals, our 
                research approach relied heavily on alternative information sources. Without the ability to conduct first-hand interviews 
                with CVI patients, we turned to online resources to develop a comprehensive understanding of their unique visual processing 
                challenges. Particularly valuable were video testimonials and educational content, including perspectives from both medical 
                professionals and families of children with CVI. 
                <br><br>
                Our research findings directly informed our UI design decisions, highlighting several critical considerations for CVI-friendly 
                interfaces. We learned that effective applications for this user group must incorporate large, clearly defined text with high 
                contrast ratios to improve visual recognition. Equally important was the elimination of distracting background elements that 
                could overwhelm visual processing capabilities. Additionally, we discovered the importance of multi-sensory feedback through 
                strategic use of color and sound cues to reinforce interactions. Accessibility remained paramount throughout our design process, 
                as we ensured the application would be fully compatible with assistive technologies such as VoiceOver and switch control, 
                providing alternative interaction methods for users with varying degrees of visual processing abilities.

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                To inform our development approach for Bubbly, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing CVI-focused applications, which 
                uncovered a market with significant limitations in usability, progressive difficulty, and clear instructions. Several applications 
                placed essential accessibility features behind paywalls, creating additional barriers for users already facing challenges. Notably, 
                apps like Tap-N-See Now Lite and the EDA PLAY series offered basic interaction mechanics without meaningful progression, while 
                others like CVI Training lacked proper onboarding or instruction. This analysis highlighted crucial opportunities for Bubbly to 
                stand out through intuitive navigation, comprehensive customization options available without paywalls, and engaging gameplay 
                that progressively adapts to users' developing visual capabilities.

            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure our design decisions were firmly rooted in user needs, I developed three distinct personas representing the primary 
                stakeholders of the Bubbly application. These personas‚Äîa child with CVI, an educator, and a parent‚Äîreflect the multi-user 
                ecosystem surrounding assistive educational technology and helped our team maintain focus on diverse user requirements throughout 
                the development process. By identifying specific goals, frustrations, and expectations for each persona type, we gained valuable 
                insight into the varying perspectives and needs that our application would need to address. These personas served as constant 
                reference points during design discussions, enabling us to evaluate potential features against concrete user profiles rather 
                than abstract requirements, ultimately leading to more intentional and user-centered design decisions.

            <h3>User Journey</h3>
            <p>
                To create a truly effective application, I mapped the complete user experience from initial download to gameplay and 
                feedback, capturing both the functional steps and emotional responses at each touchpoint. This journey analysis 
                acknowledged the dual-user nature of Bubbly ‚Äì recognizing that while children with CVI are the primary users, their 
                guardians and/or teachers play a crucial facilitating role ‚Äî and helped identify key improvement opportunities 
                throughout the experience. By anticipating emotional responses ranging from a guardian/teacher's relief at finding 
                a specialized educational tool to a child's frustration or satisfaction during gameplay, we were able to prioritize 
                critical features like, clear navigation options, appropriate difficulty progression, and multimodal feedback that 
                would create a more intuitive and rewarding experience for all users.

            <h3>User Flow</h3>
            <p>
                To translate our understanding of user needs into a functional structure for the Bubbly application, I created a comprehensive 
                user flow diagram mapping the critical pathways through the app. This visualization captures the complete experience from 
                initial download to gameplay completion, illustrating how both first-time and returning users navigate the application. The 
                flow highlights key decision points and interaction opportunities, ensuring the interface would accommodate the unique needs 
                of children with CVI while providing guardians with necessary customization options.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/images/bubbly-user-flow.png">

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
                The initial wireframes for Bubbly demonstrate a deliberate focus on accessibility for users with Cortical Visual Impairment. 
                Embracing the principle that less is more for CVI users, these designs feature minimal distractions, essential elements only, 
                and consistently enlarged text throughout all screens. This intentional simplicity established the foundation for all subsequent 
                iterations, ensuring the interface would remain intuitive and accessible for children with unique visual processing challenges.

                I quickly identified that portrait mode created significant usability constraints ‚Äî answer options would be positioned too closely 
                together and there would be insufficient space for longer words. After pivoting to a landscape-only approach, unanimously supported 
                by the team as essential for accessibility, I developed several gameplay arrangement options that maximized this new spatial advantage 
                while maintaining the simplified interface required for users with CVI.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                After evaluating multiple layout configurations with the team, I eliminated options that placed answer choices at the bottom or top 
                of the screen due to spacing constraints for longer words. After testing the layouts with different answer options, I finalized the 
                arrangement with answer options on the left side with the answer area on the right because it created a clearer visual separation 
                between selection and placement zones ‚Äî an important distinction for users with CVI who benefit from well-defined spatial organization. 
                <br><br>
                In the refined wireframe, I implemented a strategic visual hierarchy to accommodate the distinct needs of our multiple user types. By 
                applying different contrast levels and sizing to interface elements, I created clear differentiation between components intended for 
                children with CVI versus those for teachers and parents. Elements primarily accessed by educators were designed with lower contrast 
                and smaller dimensions, while game elements for CVI users featured high contrast and larger sizing. This approach reflected client 
                feedback that children would rarely access setup or settings functions independently, as the app would typically be configured by 
                adults in classroom settings. The deliberate visual distinction minimizes potential distractions for CVI users, allowing them to 
                focus exclusively on the gameplay elements most relevant to their experience.

            <p>
                <br>
                The launch of Bubbly marked a significant milestone in accessible educational technology for children with Cortical Visual 
                Impairment. The application has been enthusiastically embraced by the CVI community, with educators and parents providing 
                overwhelmingly positive feedback about its effectiveness and accessibility. Since its release, Bubbly has achieved over 
                200,000 downloads and has been implemented across multiple school districts in Colorado as an official educational resource 
                for students with CVI.
                <br><br>
                The most rewarding aspect of this project has been witnessing its real-world impact through user testimonials:
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <div class="bubbly-quotes">
                <blockquote id="extra-space">
                    <p>"This is simply fantastic! A huge congratulations to your team!"</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote id="extra-space">
                    <p>"I tried this app with one of my preschoolers who has a diagnosis with CVI this week! And she absolutely LOVED it!"</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"I didn't have to teach her the game. She picked it up pretty fast. She kept saying after every letter, 'I did it!'!"</p>
                </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>
                <br>
                These responses validate our design approach and confirm that Bubbly successfully meets the specialized needs of its target users. 
                Particularly gratifying was the feedback about intuitive usability‚Äîlearning that children could independently engage with the 
                application without extensive instruction demonstrated that our focus on simplicity and accessibility had achieved its intended 
                purpose.
                <br><br>
                Bubbly remains one of my most meaningful projects because it challenged me to design for users whose experiences differ 
                significantly from my own. The process of researching, understanding, and empathizing with the unique visual processing challenges 
                faced by children with CVI pushed me to expand my perspective as a designer. This experience reinforced the importance of inclusive 
                design practices and the profound impact thoughtfully created technology can have on underserved communities. The success of 
                Bubbly has not only benefited its users but has fundamentally shaped my approach to user-centered design.
