        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) is the most common visual impairment diagnosis in
            the USA, and there is no close second place. Still, most people have never heard of it.
            <br><br>
            It’s most common in babies and young children, but can continue into adulthood.
            A child with CVI has vision problems that are caused by their brain that can’t be
            explained by a problem with their eyes. The disorder is caused by damage to the
            parts of the brain that process vision, which disrupts the brain's communication with the eyes.
            <br><br>
            Normally, the eyes send electrical signals to the brain, and the brain turns those
            signals into images. With CVI, your brain has trouble processing and understanding
            these signals.
            <br><br>
            Cortical visual impairment is often referred to by other terms including: cerebral
            visual impairment, neurological visual impairment, and brain damage related visual
            impairment.
            <br><br>
            The wonderful reality of CVI is that it can get better with appropriate intervention.
            Although there’s no direct cure, vision rehabilitation can help people with CVI make
            the most of their vision.
            <br><br>
            Babies and kids with CVI need early intervention and therapy, educational support,
            and other special services to help them develop and learn.
            <br><br>
            There are not many apps available for Android or iOS that cater to students with
            CVI. Due to their unique visual needs and often young age, most students with CVI
            cannot access the abundant online literacy resources that are available to their
            sighted peers.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            We will be developing an interactive gaming app that allows younger students with
            CVI to playfully improve their condition and gradually improve their vision.
            <br><br>
            Children with CVI need to be taught to understand what they are seeing by
            highlighting the shapes and salient features of the words.
            <br><br>
            An example game would be dragging and dropping words into their bubbled
            shapes. The bubble-word strategy was developed by Dr. Christine Roman-Lantzy.
        </p>
        <h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
        <p>
            There are few apps on the App Store for people with CVI and even fewer focusing on 
            literacy specifically.
        </p>
