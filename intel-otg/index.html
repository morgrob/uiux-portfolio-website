            <h2>üñºÔ∏è Background</h2>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>
                <br>
                Throughout my co-op with Intel‚Äôs Olympics Technology Group (OTG), which was during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, I worked on 
                designing innovative technology that leveraged Intel‚Äôs 3DAT (3D Athlete Tracking) system to analyze athletic performance. As the 
                largest sponsor of the Olympics, Intel invested heavily in cutting-edge sports technology, and OTG was responsible for developing 
                new applications that could potentially be adopted by stakeholders. Over seven months, I designed six web applications, each powered 
                by 3DAT data, and presented them to stakeholders while collaborating closely with contracted developers to bring them to life.
                <br><br>
                OTG was a small sector within Intel, and the UI/UX Design co-op, who was replaced every 6 months, was the sole designer on the team. 
                This experience, while initially intimidating as only my second internship, became transformative for my design approach. In this 
                position, I quickly recognized that my initial lack of sports technology expertise was actually an advantage. It positioned me to 
                bridge the gap between complex performance data and intuitive user experiences‚Äîmaking sophisticated athletic metrics accessible to 
                average users. This challenge of translating specialized data into understandable insights helped me develop a passion for fitness 
                technology while teaching me to leverage my outsider perspective as a design strength rather than a limitation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-1 row-cols-md-1 row-cols-lg-1 row-cols-xl-1">
            <h2>üîÑ Process</h2>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>
                <br>
                During my seven-month co-op with Intel's Olympics Technology Group, I worked exclusively with their groundbreaking 3D Athlete Tracking 
                (3DAT) system to design six web applications that translated complex athletic performance data into intuitive user experiences. As the 
                sole designer on a specialized team, I quickly adapted to the fast-paced environment, dedicating approximately one month to each 
                application after initial onboarding.
                <br><br>
                Each application followed a structured yet agile design process that balanced technical innovation with user accessibility:
            </p>
            <h5>Team Collaboration</h5>
            <p>I worked within a focused four-person subteam that included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b style="color: white;">A product manager </b>who established direction, timelines, and narrative.</p></li>
                <li><p><b style="color: white;">A product engineer </b>with biomechanics expertise.</p></li>
                <li><p>Myself as the <b style="color: white;">UI/UX design co-op </b>responsible for all prototypes.</p></li>
                <li><p><b style="color: white;">A biomechanics co-op </b>supporting 3DAT software development.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Concept Development</h5>
                <p>
                    The process began with the product manager presenting a concept and narrative (e.g., a 3DAT-powered golf swing analysis tool for 
                    professional athletes). During initial meetings, we collaboratively brainstormed potential features that would fulfill both 
                    technical capabilities and user needs.
                </p>
            <h5>Individual Ideation to Collective Design</h5>
                <p>
                    Following concept introduction, each team member‚Äîregardless of role‚Äîcreated individual sketches and ideas for the application's 
                    functionality and appearance. This multidisciplinary approach ensured diverse perspectives informed the design from the earliest 
                    stages.
                </p>
            <h5>Collaborative Refinement</h5>
                <p>
                    In follow-up meetings, we presented our individual concepts and identified the most compelling features from each. During these 
                    sessions, I took detailed notes while asking clarifying questions about biomechanics fundamentals to ensure data visualization 
                    would be both accurate and accessible.
                </p>
            <h5>Iterative Wireframing</h5>
                <p>
                    I synthesized the team's input into wireframes that integrated preferred features and addressed technical requirements. These 
                    wireframes underwent multiple iterations based on team feedback, with particular focus on transforming complex athletic data 
                    into intuitive visual presentations.
                </p>
            <h5>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h5>
                <p>
                    The finalized wireframes evolved into high-fidelity prototypes through continuous refinement. I presented progress updates 
                    every few days to gather feedback and ensure alignment with project goals.
                </p>
            <h5>Development Handoff and Stakeholder Presentations</h5>
                <p>
                    Once prototypes reached completion, I presented them to contracted developers with emphasis on functionality and implementation 
                    requirements. I maintained communication throughout development to ensure design integrity.
                    <br><br>
                    Simultaneously, I delivered presentations to stakeholders during larger meetings. These presentations focused on narrative and 
                    value proposition, directly influencing investment decisions for each project.
                    <br><br>
                    This systematic yet flexible approach allowed me to successfully design six specialized applications within tight timeframes 
                    while ensuring they effectively translated complex athletic data into accessible insights for targeted users.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    SWING is a web app powered by 3DAT that takes in videos of athletes taking golf swings and outputs a 3D model of the motions in the 
                    video and multiple different visualizations of data collected from these motions. This web app allows the user to scrub through the 
                    3D captured motions and look through multiple interactive charts and tables that provide valuable feedback on their swing form 
                    including X-Factor, Sway, Kinetic Chain, snapshots at each phase of the swing, and various other metrics. Additionally, this web app 
                    also allows the user to upload multiple videos to compare different golf swings.

            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>
                <br>
                The six 3DAT applications I designed during my co-op with Intel's Olympics Technology Group garnered significant recognition, 
                particularly at industry trade shows where they showcased the innovative fusion of technology and athletic performance analysis. 
                Our applications consistently captured attention from industry professionals, athletic organizations, and potential partners 
                who witnessed firsthand how Intel's technology could revolutionize training and performance assessment. The intuitive interfaces 
                I created were instrumental in translating complex biomechanical concepts into accessible, valuable tools for diverse audiences.
                <br><br>
                My contributions helped establish Intel as a pioneer in sports technology, expanding their reputation beyond traditional computing 
                into cutting-edge athletic analysis. These applications demonstrated practical implementations of 3DAT that effectively bridged 
                the gap between complex data collection and actionable athletic insights for both technical and non-technical users. Despite my 
                seven-month tenure, several of my designs became enduring assets for Intel, continuing to serve as demonstration tools and 
                reference points for future sports technology initiatives long after my departure. The design systems and visualization approaches 
                I developed created a foundation that subsequent designers could build upon, extending my impact beyond my time with the team.
                <br><br>
                This experience profoundly influenced my approach to design challenges. By successfully transforming specialized data into intuitive 
                visual experiences under tight deadlines, I developed valuable skills in rapid prototyping, cross-functional collaboration, and 
                technical communication that continue to shape my professional practice today. The ability to make complex information meaningful 
                and accessible across varying levels of technical proficiency has become a cornerstone of my design philosophy.
