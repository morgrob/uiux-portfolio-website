            <h2>üñºÔ∏è Background</h2>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>
                <br>
                The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) was built over 200 years with little to no consideration 
                for mobility challenges. In recent years, the university has made efforts to address some of its accessibility issues 
                such as the modernization of some elevators and the construction of a permanent ramp on the Old Well to allow students 
                with limited mobility to participate in the first day of class tradition to sip from the fountain. However, navigating 
                the campus remains difficult, especially for those with disabilities. To name just a couple daily obstacles; there is 
                constant construction blocking pathways, and the brick sidewalks are uneven and often missing bricks, leading to large, 
                deep puddles when it rains. These are the kinds of barriers that highlight the need for a tool to make navigating campus 
                easier, which is where Luminary comes in. 
                <br><br>
                In early 2023, Tar Heels at the Table (THATT), an accessibility advocacy group on campus, reached out to App Team Carolina, 
                a nonprofit organization on campus that builds iOS apps, with the idea to make an app that informs users about temporary 
                and permanent accessibility obstacles on campus and provides alternate routes to locations based on the user‚Äôs unique 
                accessibility preferences. As a founding executive member of App Team Carolina, I was super eager to take on the project 
                not only a UI/UX designer, but also as a team lead for the project. This means that in addition to creating the designs 
                for the app, I also guide a dynamic team of developers, designers, marketers, and product managers toward release to the 
                App Store. 
                <br><br>
                This project is particularly dear to me as it aligns perfectly with my passion for creating inclusive designs that work 
                for everyone, regardless of ability. Luminary has also been my first opportunity to shepherd a project from initial concept 
                through to completion, allowing me to apply my design philosophy in a meaningful way that directly impacts my campus community.

            <h3>Preliminary Research</h3>
            <p>
                After establishing the app‚Äôs concept and purpose with THATT, the first step for our team was to get a better understanding 
                of the specific types of issues students face on campus in terms of accessibility. In order to do this, I worked with our 
                product managers to create a survey asking respondents to select issues from a checklist (or write in new ones) that are 
                prominent in their experience navigating campus and share other details about 
                their experiences. This survey was distributed to students with disabilities as well as accessibility advocates through 
                THATT and UNC‚Äôs Equal Opportunity and Compliance office.
                <br><br>
                Below are some of the results of this survey showing the most prominent accessibility issues faced on UNC's campus with the 
                percentage of respondants who reported each as an issue they face in daily campus navigation:

            <h3>Defining Features</h3>
            <p>
                At this point, we defined the features to include in Luminary and ranked them by priority. The four features listed below were deemed 
                necessary for our minimum viable product because they provide the most complete solution to the problem at hand while still 
                being technically feasible in a reasonable amount of time. 
            </p>
            <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-4 row-cols-xl-4 g-2">
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Obstacle reporting</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Outdoor turn-by-turn navigation</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Obstacle avoidance preferences</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Accessible entrace locating</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                <br><br>
                The next three features were deemed unnecessary for the minimum viable product but still feasible and valuable enough to be 
                included in the next version of Luminary.
            </p>

            <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-4 row-cols-xl-4 g-2">
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Obstacle notifications</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Accessible restroom locating</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">User interaction (i.e. commenting, upvoting)</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                <br><br>
                These last two features are our "moonshot" features, which would be very valuable to Luminary's users, but they are not 
                currently feasible with our development and budgetary restraints.
            </p>

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                While there were no direct competitors to this particular concept available on the App Store already, I did an audit 
                on popular navigation apps Waze, Google Maps, and Apple Maps to get a sense of their accessibility-specific features 
                and to highlight the gaps that Luminary fills.

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                Below is the information architecture diagram outlining the structure and flow of the app, ensuring a clear and intuitive 
                user experience by organizing content and navigation effectively.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
                When Luminary was brought to App Team Carolina, THATT provided some basic designs as a proof of concept for me to 
                work from, which are shown below.
            </p>
            <div class="row row-cols-2 row-cols-sm-2 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-4 row-cols-xl-4">
                <img class="mockup-screen" src="../assets/images/polaris-home.png">
                <img class="mockup-screen" src="../assets/images/polaris-map.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                <br>
                From here, I referred to this proof of concept as a starting point along with the features we defined as a team and my 
                information architecture to create the following sketches of Luminary.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
                Next, I adapted those sketches into a basic wireframe, which I presented to my team of developers and product managers 
                for feedback on the direction of the design and the overall structure of the app thus far. 
            </p>

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>
                Prior to converting the wireframe into a high-fidelity prototype, it was important to establish the visual identity of 
                the app. When the project was brought to App Team Carolina, it was called Polaris. After some research on existing apps, 
                products, and other search results online and on the App Store, I decided to rebrand the app to ensure a more distinct 
                and memorable identity. 
                <br><br>
                For the name, I searched for synonyms of words related to wayfinding and came up with the following options, of which 
                the team and I chose Luminary as the best option. 
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                <br>
                For the app icon, I created a few different options and mocked them up on different colors to present to my team, 
                which are shown below. I worked mostly with more simple concepts to keep the visual identity clean, but I also 
                included a more fun one in case the team or THATT preferred a more whimsical vibe. When I presented the options to 
                the team, we agreed the lightbulb version was the most consistent with the mission as well as the most recognizable. 
                <br><br>
                For the color, I chose a medium blue because it aligned the most with the purpose and intended feel of the app, and 
                I knew it would be used for accent colors in the interface later.

            <h3>Current Version</h3>
            <p>
                By August 2024, I had completed two summer internships as a product designer since making the first version above, 
                and I knew there was a lot of room for improvement. I decided to revamp the design with the main goals of making it 
                cleaner, more intuitive for users, and more interactive in the prototype. 
                <br><br>
                The biggest updates made for this new version were:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Removing the tab bar because I felt navigating the app was aimpler without it.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Adding an onboarding sequence to collect the obstacles the user needs to avoid in routing and add favorites before entering the app.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Adding a new feature called quick reports, which allows users to report common obstacles without having to fill out the form every time.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
