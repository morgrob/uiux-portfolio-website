            <h2>üñºÔ∏è Background</h2>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>
                <br>
                The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) was built over 200 years with little to no consideration 
                for mobility challenges. In recent years, the university has made efforts to address some of its accessibility issues 
                such as the modernization of some elevators and the construction of a permanent ramp on the Old Well to allow students 
                with limited mobility to participate in the first day of class tradition to sip from the fountain. However, navigating 
                the campus remains difficult, especially for those with disabilities. To name just a couple daily obstacles; there is 
                constant construction blocking pathways, and the brick sidewalks are uneven and often missing bricks, leading to large, 
                deep puddles when it rains. These are the kinds of barriers that highlight the need for a tool to make navigating campus 
                easier, which is where Luminary comes in. 
                <br><br>
                In early 2023, Tar Heels at the Table (THATT), an accessibility advocacy group on campus, reached out to App Team Carolina, 
                a nonprofit organization on campus that builds iOS apps, with the idea to make an app that informs users about temporary 
                and permanent accessibility obstacles on campus and provides alternate routes to locations based on the user‚Äôs unique 
                accessibility preferences. As a founding executive member of App Team Carolina, I was super eager to take on the project 
                not only a UI/UX designer, but also as a team lead for the project. This means that in addition to creating the designs 
                for the app, I also guide a dynamic team of developers, designers, marketers, and product managers toward release to the 
                App Store. 
                <br><br>
                This project is particularly dear to me as it aligns perfectly with my passion for creating inclusive designs that work 
                for everyone, regardless of ability. Luminary has also been my first opportunity to lead a project from initial concept 
                through to completion, allowing me to apply my design philosophy in a meaningful way that directly impacts my campus community.

            <h3>Preliminary Research</h3>
            <p>
                After partnering with THATT to define the app's vision, our team needed to gain deeper insights into the specific accessibility 
                challenges students encounter on campus. I collaborated with our product managers to develop a comprehensive survey where 
                respondents could identify issues from a checklist, add new concerns, and share personal experiences navigating UNC. To reach 
                our target audience effectively, we distributed the survey through both THATT's network and UNC's Equal Opportunity and Compliance 
                office, connecting with students with disabilities and accessibility advocates across campus.
                <br><br>
                The survey results below highlight the most significant accessibility barriers on UNC's campus, showing the percentage of respondents 
                who identified each issue as impacting their daily campus navigation:

            <h3>Defining Features</h3>
            <p>
                To progress from research insights to development planning, I partnered with our product managers to identify and prioritize 
                Luminary's core features. Through careful evaluation of user needs, technical feasibility, and development timelines, we established 
                our minimum viable product criteria. The following four features were selected as essential components that would deliver a 
                comprehensive solution to campus accessibility challenges while remaining achievable within our projected timeframe:
            </p>
            <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-4 row-cols-xl-4 g-2">
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Obstacle reporting functionality</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Outdoor turn-by-turn navigation capabilities</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Customizable obstacle avoidance preferences</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Accessible entrace location identification</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                <br><br>
                Following our core feature prioritization, we identified three additional capabilities that, while valuable, were not essential for our 
                initial launch. These features were categorized for inclusion in Luminary's subsequent release, balancing enhanced user experience with 
                development resources:
            </p>

            <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-4 row-cols-xl-4 g-2">
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Proximity-based obstacle notifications</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Accessible restroom locator functionality</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">
                        <div class="info-block-main">Social interaction (i.e. commenting, upvoting)</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                <br><br>
                We also identified two aspirational "moonshot" features that would significantly enhance Luminary's value proposition but exceed our 
                current technical capabilities and resource constraints:
            </p>

            <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-4 row-cols-xl-4 g-2">

                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <div class="feature-mvp">

                    </div>

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Before developing Luminary's interface and feature set, it was essential to understand how existing navigation solutions 
                address‚Äîor fail to address‚Äîaccessibility concerns. While no direct competitors offer campus-specific accessibility navigation, 
                several widely-used mapping applications provide related functionality that users may already be familiar with.
                <br><br>
                The following competitive analysis examines how Luminary's proposed features compare to established navigation platforms like Waze, 
                Google Maps, and Apple Maps. This comparison highlights the significant gaps in accessibility navigation that Luminary aims to fill, 
                while also identifying successful patterns from these platforms that could inform my design decisions.

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                At this point, I made the following diagram, which shows Luminary's comprehensive information architecture. This visual representation 
                maps the logical progression between key screens and features, highlighting how users will navigate through the application to accomplish 
                their accessibility-focused goals.

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
                When THATT approached App Team Carolina with the Luminary concept, they provided preliminary design mockups to illustrate their vision. 
                These proof-of-concept designs, displayed below, were my starting point and reference for understanding THATT's core requirements and 
                expectations for the app. While basic in execution, these initial mockups captured essential functionality and helped establish a shared 
                understanding of Luminary's purpose before I began the formal design process.

            <p>
                <br>
                With THATT's proof-of-concept as reference, I began translating their vision into more structured design artifacts. I started by 
                creating hand-drawn sketches to explore different layout options and user flows, allowing for rapid ideation and iteration. 
                These preliminary sketches evolved into basic wireframes that defined the fundamental structure and information hierarchy of 
                Luminary's interface. I then presented these wireframes to our cross-functional team of developers and product managers to gather 
                early feedback on the design direction and validate that the proposed structure would effectively support our technical requirements 
                and user needs.

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>
                Before advancing from wireframes to a high-fidelity prototype, I needed to establish a distinctive visual identity for the app. 
                The project initially came to App Team Carolina under the name "Polaris." However, after conducting thorough research on existing 
                applications, products, and online search results‚Äîparticularly within the App Store‚ÄîI determined that a rebrand was necessary to 
                create a more unique and memorable presence. 
                <br><br>
                To find an appropriate new name, I explored synonyms related to wayfinding, navigation, and guidance. I compiled the following 
                list of potential options and collaborated with the team to evaluate each candidate. After careful consideration, we collectively 
                selected "Luminary" as the optimal choice, feeling it best conveyed the app's purpose of illuminating accessible paths through 
                campus while establishing a distinctive brand identity.

                <br>
                To complete Luminary's visual identity, I developed several app icon concepts and presented them with various background 
                color options to my team. My approach focused primarily on clean, minimalist designs that would be instantly recognizable 
                at small scales, though I included one more playful concept to offer stylistic range and gauge preference for a potentially 
                more whimsical direction. 
                <br><br>
                After reviewing all options collectively, our team reached consensus that the lightbulb concept most effectively communicated 
                the app's mission‚Äîilluminating accessible pathways through campus‚Äîwhile also offering the strongest visual recognition factor. 
                This alignment between symbolism and functionality made it the clear choice for Luminary's visual representation.
                <br><br>
                For the color palette, I selected a medium blue as the primary brand color. This choice was deliberate, as blue conveys 
                reliability, accessibility, and clarity‚Äîqualities central to Luminary's purpose. Additionally, I anticipated this blue would 
                function effectively as an accent color throughout the interface, providing visual continuity while meeting accessibility 
                standards for contrast and readability.

            <h3>Current Version</h3>
            <p>
                By August 2024, I had completed two summer internships as a product designer since making the first version above, 
                and I knew there was a lot of room for improvement. I decided to revamp the design with the main goals of making it 
                cleaner, more unique, more intuitive for users, and more interactive in the prototype. 
                <br><br>
                The biggest updates made for this new version were:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Removing the tab bar because I felt navigating the app was aimpler without it.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Adding an onboarding sequence to collect the obstacles the user needs to avoid in routing and add favorites before entering the app.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Adding a new feature called quick reports, which allows users to report common obstacles without having to fill out the form every time.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Increased rounding on corners where applicable to achieve a more modern feel.</p></li>

                <br>
                Luminary has the potential to transform daily life at UNC-Chapel Hill by democratizing campus navigation for everyone, 
                regardless of mobility needs. By crowdsourcing real-time accessibility information, the app could eliminate the 
                frustrating trial-and-error experience many students, faculty, and visitors with disabilities currently face when 
                traversing campus. Beyond its immediate practical benefits, Luminary represents a cultural shift toward collective 
                responsibility for accessibility‚Äîeach user who reports an obstacle contributes to a more inclusive campus environment. 
                The data collected could also prove invaluable to university administration by highlighting persistent trouble spots 
                that require permanent infrastructure solutions, potentially influencing future campus development priorities. As 
                adoption grows, Luminary could foster greater independence for individuals with mobility challenges, increase their 
                participation in campus activities, and ultimately help transform UNC from a historically inaccessible campus to a 
                model for how technology and community engagement can overcome physical barriers in educational spaces.
