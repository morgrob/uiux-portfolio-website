            <h2>üñºÔ∏è Background</h2>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>
                <br>
                The inspiration for Centible came from a fundamental problem faced by many college students: the lack of intuitive 
                financial management tools designed specifically for young adults navigating independent living. Developed through 
                App Team Carolina, a student organization dedicated to iOS design and development, Centible aims to address the unique 
                financial challenges of students with unpredictable, fluctuating incomes.
                <br><br>
                As a UI designer on the project during its first five months, I was instrumental in shaping the app's user experience 
                and visual design. Centible stands apart from conventional finance management applications by prioritizing user 
                engagement and financial awareness. Unlike complex apps with intimidating features like stock trading and insurance 
                details, Centible focuses on core financial literacy. The app's key innovation lies in its interactive transaction 
                sorting system (i.e. "Quick Sort"), which guides users through their spending history one transaction at a time, 
                encouraging mindful categorization and reflection.
                <br><br>
                By securely connecting to users' bank accounts through Plaid, Centible offers a comprehensive yet approachable 
                financial overview. The app provides insights into spending patterns across multiple account types, with simple, 
                intuitive graphics that make financial tracking less overwhelming and more accessible to young adults learning to 
                manage their money independently. Our goal with Centible is not just to track expenses, but to cultivate financial 
                mindfulness among students, transforming financial management from a chore into an empowering learning experience.

            <div class="separator"></div>
            <h3>Preliminary Research</h3>
            <p>
                Our user research process began with a comprehensive investigation into how college students manage their personal 
                finances. Working closely with our product manager, we conducted an in-depth exploration of the financial tracking 
                challenges faced by our target demographic.
                <br><br>
                Our interviews and surveys revealed that most students were bypassing sophisticated digital tools in favor of manual 
                tracking methods. Spreadsheets, handwritten notebooks, and ad-hoc tracking systems were the norm, highlighting a 
                significant gap in the market for intuitive financial management solutions. The product manager led user research 
                efforts, systematically defining the problem space through targeted interviews and user persona development. These 
                insights were crucial in shaping Centible's core value proposition, ultimately validating our hypothesis that students 
                needed a financial tracking tool that was not just functional, but engaging and adaptable to their unique lifestyle.

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The following information architecture diagram illustrates the core navigation and feature structure of Centible, 
                mapping out how users will interact with the app's primary screens and functionality. This diagram provides a blueprint
                of the app's user flow and key interface components.

            <h3>Proof of Concept</h3>
            <p>
                To validate the idea of Centible, I developed this low-fidelity prototype that presented a basic design of the app's home 
                screen and transaction list. The initial prototype focused on demonstrating the app's potential layout and core functionality, 
                featuring a clean interface that displayed bank account connections, total spending overview, and an initial view of recent 
                transactions. By creating a simplified design that highlighted the app's potential for clear, straightforward financial tracking, 
                I aimed to provide a preliminary glimpse into how Centible could simplify financial management for students by presenting spending 
                information in an accessible, less intimidating format.

            <h3>First Version</h3>
                <p>
                    The following demo video showcases the first draft of Centible's prototype, presenting my initial home screen design and 
                    early approach to transaction categorization. After presenting this design to the team, I received critical feedback that 
                    highlighted the need for a distinct categorization view. The product manager suggested that the transaction sorting process 
                    should be separated from the transaction list and transformed into a more engaging, gamified experience to increase user 
                    interaction and motivation.

                <p>
                    This final prototyp I made for this project represents a significant evolution of Centible's design, incorporating team feedback 
                    to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience. The video showcases three key views that define the app's core functionality: 
                    the home dashboard with a comprehensive spending overview, a detailed transaction list, and the new Quick Sort view, which demos a 
                    gamified approach to transaction categorization that transforms financial tracking from a mundane task into an interactive, 
                    educational experience.

                Centible gained recognition for its unique approach to student financial management, as the app won the Best Mobile App award 
                at the Spring 2022 App-a-thon, a semester-long competition hosted by UNC's Computer Science department. This recognition not only 
                validated my and my team's approach to student financial management but also demonstrated the potential of our user-centered 
                design strategy.
                <br><br>
                Following the competition, Centible was released on the App Store, where it has maintained an impressive 5-star rating average. 
                Though I am no longer part of the development team, Centible continues to evolve, with the active team exploring new features, including 
                developing a premium tier to expand the app's functionality and reach. The ongoing development of Centible represents the project's 
                lasting potential to address a critical need for intuitive financial tracking among young adults.
